# p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.

This app is a starter project, which implements the [getting started tutorial example](https://p5js.org/get-started/) project, that captures mouse movement and prints circles as you move it around. It's a useful starting point for creating your own p5.js-based projects.
